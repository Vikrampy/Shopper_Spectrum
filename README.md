Shopper Spectrum: Customer Segmentation and Product Recommendations in E-Commerce (E-Commerce and Retail Analytics)


#Problem Statement
The global e-commerce industry generates vast amounts of transaction data daily, offering valuable insights into customer purchasing behaviors. Analyzing this data is essential for identifying meaningful customer segments and recommending relevant products to enhance customer experience and drive business growth. This project aims to examine transaction data from an online retail business to uncover patterns in customer purchase behavior, segment customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis, and develop a product recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques.
